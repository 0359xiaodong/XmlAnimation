XmlAnimation
============

Adding animations to your app interface will give high quality feel to your android applications.


Animations can be performed through either XML or android code. In this tutorial i explained how to do animations using XML notations. I will explain how to do the same using android java code in future tutorials. Here i covered basic android animations like fade in, fade out, scale, rotate, slide up, slide down etc.,

I wrote separate activity and XML for each animation.
